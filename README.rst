Amazon Payment Services (PayFort) Payment Processor backend for Open edX ecommerce
==================================================================================

This application provides a custom `Open edX ecommerce <https://github.com/edx/ecommerce/>`
payment processor backend for the `Amazon Payment Services <https://paymentservices-reference.payfort.com/>`_.

Getting Started with PayFort Integration Development
####################################################

The API documentation for the PayFort payment services is available at:

- https://paymentservices-reference.payfort.com/docs/api/build/index.html

Scroll through the page, it's a very long single-page documentation.

There's no official Python SDK for PayFort. But we can use the
`PayFort PHP SDK <https://github.com/payfort/payfort-php-sdk>`_ to understand the API calls and redirect mechanism.

There's a 2016 unofficial Python SDK for PayFort: https://github.com/alisterionold/payfort-python

There's a 2018 blog documenting the integration process:

- `Integrating PayFort â€” we suffered so you don't have to <https://medium.com/@jaysadiq/integrating-payfort-we-suffered-so-you-dont-have-to-23a4dbdef556>`_
